- Contributors can create, edit, and delete content in a workspace and publish reports to the workspace
- In order to transform the visual and make it useful for analysis we need to promote the headers first, then unpivot all columns except for the "Measure" column. After the unpivot, we'll need to rename the column attribute column to year and then update the datatype.
- if the file name or location changes, you will need to change the source via the Data Source Settings
- When would you use a tool from the Transform tab over the Add Column tab
    - When you want to overwrite the values of existing columns
- which two blocks make up the M code that runs your query?
    - let & in
- filter flow
    - by default, the filter direction will point from the "one" side of the relationship to the "many" side
    - When you filter a table, the filter context is passed along to all related "downstream"
    - Filters cannot flow "upstream" (against the direction of the arrow)
- Which of the following functions allows you to calculate running totals?
    - DATESINPERIOD
- In what field do measures typically "live" in a visual?
    - 'Value' field of a visual
- Before creating the data model, you’re reviewing the data in the Sales table to check for possible negative values. What action should you take in the Query Editor?
    - Select Column Profile, then select the trasations column. -- the 'profile' has 'min' and 'max' etc.
- You need to create relationships in the data model based on the VP of Inventory Management’s requirements. How should you create the relationships?
    - Create an additional date table named Stock_Date and create 1:* relationship from Calendar[date_id] to Sales[date_id], and a 1:* relationship from Stock_Date[date_id] to Sales[stock_date_id]
    - because the key word 'independantly' for filter
- You need to provide access to your team of analysts, how should you configure their access?
    - Power BI permission: **Viewer Role**
    - Permission for **dataset: build**
    - requierment: Analysts on your team are assigned to different regions, and should only be able to see data from that specific region when building
    - key: to apply RLS, only *viewer* role is possible
- You plan to create a relationship between the Calendar table and the Projections table but need to calculate the first day of each month in the Calendar table first. Keeping performance best practices in mind, which type of calculation and which formula should you use?
    - Calculation type: M code custom column
    - Formula: =Table.AddColumn(#"Inserted Start of Quarter", "Start of Month", each Date.StartOfMonth([Date]), type date)
    - **try to do work in DB query**
- You need to create a DAX measure that allows users to see forecasted sales at the appropriate level of granularity. How should you complete the following DAX measure?
    - Forcasted Sales =
    ` **IF** (
        NOT (
            **ISFILTERED**('Calendar'[Date])
        ),
        SUM('Projection'[Forecasted_Sales])
    )
    `
- You have marketing data contained in the tables shown below that's at the daily level. The Search data table contains 3 years of data with approximately 20 million records per month. You need to create a year-over-year visual to show the count of impressions by day, campaign name, and ad name that minimizes the data model size. What two things should you do
    - In order to minimize the data model size and build out a year-over-year visual, you first need to reduce the size of the dataset before loading it. Using the **group by** function in the Query Editor is the best approach here. Next, in order to create a visual, you need to **create relationships** between the tables. 
- You've built a line chart that shows revenue by month. Your manager has asked you to show mean monthly revenue on the chart. You need to add the value in a way that considers users adding other filters and involve minimal effort. What do you do?
    - Adding an average line from the analytics pane is the only option that satisfies both requirements of considering other users adding filters and involving minimal effort. You could create a DAX measure to calculate the average but it accomplishes the same thing as an average line from the analytics pane and requires more effort
- The three steps that need to happen in order to transform a JSON file to a usable data are first convert the list to a table, second expand the columns, and third set the column data types
