**Machine Learning** is the subfield of computer science that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed
- extraction of knowledge from data
- learns from past behavior and make predictions or decisions
- 3 types:
    - **supervised** learning (solutions provided by parents)
        - Data is labelled
        - Input variable "X" (or a set) and output variable "Y"
        - y = f(x) (columns as input)
        - the function is approximated to predict new values of Y given X
        -Examples
            - **Regression** - Output variable is a real value such as Amount, Height, Weight etc
            - **Classification** - Output variable is a category, such as Yes, No, Red, Blue, Yellow etc
    - **unsupervised** learning (make your own decision)
    - **reninforement** learning
